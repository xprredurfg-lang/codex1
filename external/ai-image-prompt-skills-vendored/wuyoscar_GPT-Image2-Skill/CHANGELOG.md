# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Clarified the GPT Image skill as a gallery-first, CLI-first agent runbook: analyze user prompts, search Reference Gallery/craft files, confer when useful, then invoke the packaged CLI.
- Added safer install and API-key guidance: check existing CLI/skill state first, avoid blind reinstall/overwrite, keep global/shared installs opt-in, and never write secrets unless explicitly requested.
- Updated cross-agent installation wording for Codex, OpenClaw, Claude Code, and manual skill runtimes.

## v0.2.0 — 2026-04-25

This release collects the recent documentation, gallery, skill, and discoverability updates after the initial public release.

### Highlights

- **Full split Reference Gallery Atlas** — expanded the skill references into category-level `gallery-*.md` files so agents can load the relevant prompt slice without filling the context window.
- **README selected showcase refresh** — compacted the README into representative visual panels while keeping the full 162-prompt catalog in the Reference Gallery.
- **New and reorganized gallery material** — added/updated examples for research paper figures, scientific education, screen photography, gaming HUDs, events maps, beauty/lifestyle, cinematic references, and more.
- **Codex installation clarity** — clarified that `$skill-installer` is a built-in Codex skill-management helper and added a manual Codex fallback path.
- **Bilingual README navigation** — added visible English / 中文 switching near the README top.
- **SEO and discovery polish** — added natural search terms, expanded package/plugin keywords, GitHub topics, and Star History.
