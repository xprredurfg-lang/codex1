## Philosophy

**Every skill must produce something.** No knowledge dumps — only workflow recipes that create files, projects, or configurations.

**Teach patterns, not ship scripts.** Skills describe what to do; Claude generates scripts adapted to your environment.

## Create Your Own

Use [Anthropic's official skill-creator](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) or ask Claude: "Create a new skill for [use case]"

See [SKILL_SHAPE.md](SKILL_SHAPE.md) for the authoring shape (frontmatter, sections, what to leave out) and [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for repo development conventions.

## History

Started as 105 skills — many were reference guides that Claude's training data made redundant.

- **v1** (tag: `v1-final`) — 105 skills, flat structure
- **v2** — restructured into installable plugins, "every skill must produce something"
- **v12** — 10 plugins, 44 skills
- **v13** (current) — 11 plugins, 52 skills
