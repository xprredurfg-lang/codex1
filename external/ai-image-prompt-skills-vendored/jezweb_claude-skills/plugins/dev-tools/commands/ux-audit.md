Load the `ux-audit` skill and run the audit.

The audit is interaction-first. It cannot produce a verdict without an Interaction Manifest proving real typing, clicking, sending, observing. A static DOM sweep terminates with verdict `Incomplete`.

Hard gates (cannot be downgraded): console errors / warnings = 0, network 5xx = 0, layout collapse at any tested viewport = 0. A console warning is High *minimum*. A 5xx is Critical *automatically*.

If $ARGUMENTS describes a persona ("as a busy broker", "first-time user"), lock it. If $ARGUMENTS scopes the audit ("the dashboard", "just the settings flow"), scope to that area — still exhaustive within the scope.

URL is auto-detected from wrangler.jsonc or running dev server.

Examples:
- `/ux-audit`
- `/ux-audit as a time-poor client logging in for the first time`
- `/ux-audit the billing flow`
- `/ux-audit as an SME owner — multi-pane stress focus`
