# Brains Trust

Consult other leading AI models for a second opinion. Not limited to code — works for architecture, strategy, prompting, debugging, writing, or any question where a fresh perspective helps.

## Defaults (When User Just Says "Brains Trust")

If the user triggers this skill without specifying what to consult about, apply these defaults:

1. **Pattern**: Consensus (2 models from different providers) — it's called "brains trust", not "single opinion"
2. **Scope**: Whatever Claude has been working on in the current session. Look at recent context: files edited, decisions made, architecture discussed, problems being solved.
3. **Mode**: Infer from context:
   - Recently wrote/edited code → **Code Review**
   - In a planning or design discussion → **Architecture**
   - Debugging something → **Debug**
   - Building prompts or skills → **Prompting**
   - No clear signal → **General** (ask: "what are we missing? what are our blind spots?")
4. **Models**: Pick the newest pro-tier model from 2 different providers (check `models.flared.au`). Prefer diversity: e.g. one Google + one OpenAI, or one Qwen + one Google. Never two from the same provider.
5. **Prompt focus**: "Review what we've been working on. What are we missing? What could be improved? What blind spots might we have? Are there simpler approaches we haven't considered?"

### Trigger → Default Mapping

| Trigger | Default pattern | Default scope |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| "brains trust" | Consensus (2 models) | Current session work |
| "second opinion" | Single (1 model) | Current session work |
| "ask gemini" / "ask gpt" | Single (specified provider) | Current session work |
| "peer review" | Consensus (2 models) | Recently changed files |
| "challenge this" / "devil's advocate" | Devil's advocate (1 model) | Claude's current position |

The user can always override by being specific: "brains trust this config file", "ask gemini about the auth approach", etc.

## Setup

Set at least one API key as an environment variable:

```bash
# Recommended — one key covers all providers
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-key"

# Optional — direct access (often faster/cheaper)
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
```

OpenRouter is the universal path — one key gives access to Gemini, GPT, Qwen, DeepSeek, Llama, Mistral, and more.

## Current Models

**Do not use hardcoded model IDs.** Before every consultation, fetch the current leading models:

```
https://models.flared.au/llms.txt
```

This is a live-updated, curated list of ~40 leading models from 11 providers, filtered from OpenRouter's full catalogue. Use it to pick the right model for the task.

For programmatic use in the generated Python script: `https://models.flared.au/json`

## Consultation Patterns

| Pattern | Default for | What happens |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| **Consensus** | "brains trust", "peer review" | Ask 2 models from different providers in parallel, compare where they agree/disagree |
| **Single** | "second opinion", "ask gemini", "ask gpt" | Ask one model, synthesise with your own view |
| **Devil's advocate** | "challenge this", "devil's advocate" | Ask a model to explicitly argue against your current position |

For consensus, always pick models from different providers (e.g. one Google + one Qwen) for maximum diversity of perspective.

## Modes

| Mode | When | Model tier |
|------|------|-----------|
| Code Review | Review files for bugs, patterns, security | Flash |
| Architecture | Design decisions, trade-offs | Pro |
| Debug | Stuck after 2+ failed attempts | Flash |
| Security | Vulnerability scan | Pro |
| Strategy | Business, product, approach decisions | Pro |
| Prompting | Improve prompts, system prompts, KB files | Flash |
| General | Any question, brainstorm, challenge | Flash |

**Pro tier**: The most capable model from the chosen provider (e.g. `google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview`, `openai/gpt-5.4`).
**Flash tier**: Fast, cheaper models for straightforward analysis (e.g. `google/gemini-3-flash-preview`, `qwen/qwen3.5-flash-02-23`).

## Workflow

1. **Detect available keys** — check `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` in environment. If none found, show setup instructions and stop.

2. **Fetch current models** — `WebFetch https://models.flared.au/llms.txt` and pick appropriate models based on mode (pro vs flash) and consultation pattern (single vs consensus). If user requested a specific provider ("ask gemini"), use that.

3. **Read target files** into context (if code-related). For non-code questions (strategy, prompting, general), skip file reading.

4. **Build prompt** using the AI-to-AI template from [references/prompt-templates.md](references/prompt-templates.md). Include file contents inline with `--- filename ---` separators. **Do not set output token limits** — let models reason fully.

5. **Create consultation directory** at `.jez/artifacts/brains-trust/{timestamp}-{topic}/` (e.g. `2026-03-10-1423-auth-architecture/`). Write the prompt to `prompt.txt` inside it — never pass code inline via bash arguments (shell escaping breaks it).

6. **Generate and run Python script** at `.jez/scripts/brains-trust.py` using patterns from [references/provider-api-patterns.md](references/provider-api-patterns.md):
   - Reads prompt from the consultation directory's `prompt.txt`
   - Calls the selected API(s)
   - For consensus mode: calls multiple APIs in parallel using `concurrent.futures`
   - Saves each response to `{model}.md` in the consultation directory
   - Prints results to stdout

7. **Synthesise** — read the responses, present findings to the user. Note where models agree and disagree. Add your own perspective (agree/disagree with reasoning). Let the user decide what to act on.

## When to Use

**Good use cases**:
- Before committing major architectural changes
- When stuck debugging after multiple attempts
- Architecture decisions with multiple valid options
- Reviewing security-sensitive code
- Challenging your own assumptions on strategy or approach
- Improving system prompts or KB files
- Any time you want a fresh perspective

**Avoid using for**:
- Simple syntax checks (Claude handles these)
- Every single edit (too slow, costs money)
- Questions with obvious, well-known answers

## Critical Rules

1. **Never hardcode model IDs** — always fetch from `models.flared.au` first
2. **Never cap output tokens** — don't set `max_tokens` or `maxOutputTokens`
3. **Always write prompts to file** — never pass via bash arguments
4. **Include file contents inline** — attach code context directly in the prompt
5. **Use AI-to-AI framing** — the model is advising Claude, not talking to the human
6. **Print progress to stderr** — the Python script must print status updates (`Calling gemini-2.5-pro...`, `Received response from qwen3.5-plus.`) so the user knows it's working during the 30-90 second wait
