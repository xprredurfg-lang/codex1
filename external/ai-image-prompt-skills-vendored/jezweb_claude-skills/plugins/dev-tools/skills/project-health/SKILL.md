# Project Health

One skill for everything about your project's Claude Code configuration. Run it at the start, middle, or end of a project — it figures out what's needed.

**Goal**: Zero permission prompts, well-organised context files, no cruft.

## When to Use

| You say... | What happens |
|-----------|-------------|
| "project health" / "check project" | Full audit: permissions + context + docs |
| "setup project" / "kickoff" / "bootstrap" | New project setup from scratch |
| "tidy permissions" / "clean settings" | Fix permissions file only |
| "capture learnings" / "update CLAUDE.md" | Save session discoveries |
| "add python" / "add docker permissions" | Add a preset to existing settings |
| "audit context" / "audit memory" | Context-focused audit only |

## Architecture: Sub-Agents

**Heavy analysis runs in sub-agents** to keep the main conversation clean. The main agent orchestrates; sub-agents do the scanning and return summaries.

### Agent 1: Permission Auditor

Launched with `Task(subagent_type: "general-purpose")`. Prompt:

```
Read .claude/settings.local.json.

**Discover connected MCP servers**: Use ToolSearch (search "mcp") and extract unique
server prefixes from tool names (e.g. mcp__vault__secret_list → vault).

**Discover installed skills**: Use the Skill tool or ToolSearch to list available skills.
For each skill that has scripts/ in its directory, note what Bash patterns it needs
(python3, env var prefixes like GEMINI_API_KEY=*, etc.). Check the SKILL.md for any
MCP tools the skill references (e.g. mcp__vault__secret_get).

Report:
1. MCP servers connected but NOT in settings (missing)
2. MCP servers in settings but NOT connected (stale)
3. Skill permissions: Bash patterns and MCP tools that installed skills need but aren't approved
4. File access: check for Read/Edit/Write patterns for .claude/** and //tmp/**
   in project settings, and ~/Documents/**/~/.claude/** in global settings
5. Leaked secrets: entries containing API keys, tokens, bearer strings, hex >20 chars, base64 >20 chars
6. Legacy colon syntax: entries like Bash(git:*) instead of Bash(git *)
7. Junk entries: shell fragments (Bash(do), Bash(fi), Bash(then), Bash(else), Bash(done)),
   __NEW_LINE_* artefacts, loop body fragments (Bash(break), Bash(continue), Bash(echo *))
8. Duplicates: entries covered by a broader pattern (e.g. Bash(git add *) redundant if Bash(git *) exists)
9. Missing presets: based on files present, suggest presets from [permission-presets.md]

Prefer Read/Glob/Grep tools over Bash. If you need to scan multiple files or
run 3+ commands for one analysis, write a Python script to .jez/scripts/
and run it once (mkdir -p .jez/scripts first).

Return a structured summary, not raw data.
```

### Agent 2: Context Auditor

Launched with `Task(subagent_type: "general-purpose")`. Prompt:

```
Audit the project context landscape at [repo-path]:

1. Find all CLAUDE.md files. For each:
   - Count lines (target: root 50-150, subdirs 15-50)
   - Score quality on 6 criteria (see quality-criteria.md)
   - Check for stale file/path references
   - Flag oversized files

2. Find .claude/rules/ topic files. Check sizes (target: 20-80 lines).

3. Detect project type from files present (see project-types.md).
   Check expected docs exist (ARCHITECTURE.md, DATABASE_SCHEMA.md, etc.)

4. Find public markdown (README.md, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md).
   Check for overlap with CLAUDE.md content.

5. Check auto-memory at ~/.claude/projects/*/memory/MEMORY.md

6. If Cloudflare project: find all wrangler.jsonc/wrangler.toml files.
   Check each has "observability": { "enabled": true }. Flag any missing it.

Prefer Read/Glob/Grep tools over Bash. If you need to scan many files or
aggregate data across the repo, write a Python script to .jez/scripts/
and run it once rather than running many individual bash commands
(mkdir -p .jez/scripts first).

Return: project type, quality scores, missing docs, stale refs, overlaps,
size violations, observability gaps, and total markdown footprint.
```

### Parallel Execution

For a full health check, **launch both agents in parallel**:

```
Task(subagent_type: "general-purpose", name: "permission-audit", prompt: "...")
Task(subagent_type: "general-purpose", name: "context-audit", prompt: "...")
```

Both return summaries. The main agent combines them into one report and proposes fixes.

## Mode 1: Full Health Check

**The default.** Run this anytime.

### Steps

1. Launch Permission Auditor and Context Auditor agents **in parallel**
2. Combine findings into a single report:

   ```
   ## Project Health Report

   **Project type**: [detected type]
   **CLAUDE.md quality**: [score]/100 ([grade])

   ### Permissions
   - Missing MCP servers: [list]
   - Leaked secrets: [count] found
   - Legacy syntax: [count] entries
   - Missing presets: [list]

   ### Context
   - Oversized files: [list]
   - Stale references: [list]
   - Missing docs: [list]
   - Overlaps: [list]

   ### Recommended Fixes
   1. [fix 1]
   2. [fix 2]
   ...
   ```

3. Apply fixes after single yes/no confirmation

## Mode 2: New Project Setup

**When**: No `.claude/settings.local.json` exists, or user says "setup" / "kickoff".

### Steps

1. **Detect project type** from files present:

   | Indicator | Type | Preset |
   |-----------|------|--------|
   | `wrangler.jsonc` or `wrangler.toml` | cloudflare-worker | JS/TS + Cloudflare |
   | `vercel.json` or `next.config.*` | vercel-app | JS/TS + Vercel |
   | `astro.config.*` | astro | JS/TS + Static Sites |
   | `package.json` (no deploy target) | javascript-typescript | JS/TS |
   | `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py` or `requirements.txt` | python | Python |
   | `Cargo.toml` | rust | Rust |
   | `go.mod` | go | Go |
   | `Gemfile` or `Rakefile` | ruby | Ruby |
   | `composer.json` or `wp-config.php` | php | PHP |
   | `pom.xml` or `build.gradle*` | java | Java/JVM |
   | `*.sln` or `*.csproj` | dotnet | .NET |
   | `mix.exs` | elixir | Elixir |
   | `Package.swift` | swift | Swift + macOS |
   | `pubspec.yaml` | flutter | Mobile |
   | `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml` | docker | Docker |
   | `fly.toml` or `railway.json` or `netlify.toml` | hosted-app | Hosting Platforms |
   | `supabase/config.toml` | supabase | Hosting + Database |
   | `.claude/agents/` or operational scripts | ops-admin | — |
   | Empty directory | Ask the user | — |

   Types stack (e.g. cloudflare-worker + javascript-typescript).

2. **Generate `.claude/settings.local.json`**:
   - Read [references/permission-presets.md](references/permission-presets.md)
   - Always include Universal Base (includes file access for `.claude/**`, `//tmp/**`)
   - Add detected language + deployment presets
   - Check if global `~/.claude/settings.local.json` has home-relative file access
     patterns (`~/Documents/**`, `~/.claude/**`). If not, suggest adding them there
     (NOT in the project file — home paths belong in global settings only)
   - **Launch Permission Auditor agent** to discover MCP servers and add per-server wildcards
   - Always include `WebSearch`, `WebFetch`
   - Always include explicit `gh` subcommands (workaround for `Bash(gh *)` bug)
   - Write with `//` comment groups

3. **Generate `CLAUDE.md`**:
   - Read [references/templates.md](references/templates.md)
   - Use project-type-appropriate template

4. **Generate `.gitignore`**:
   - Read [references/templates.md](references/templates.md)
   - Always include `.claude/settings.local.json`, `.claude/plans/`, `.jez/screenshots/`, `.jez/artifacts/`
   - Do NOT gitignore `.jez/scripts/` — generated scripts are worth keeping

5. **Optionally** (ask first): `git init` + `gh repo create`

6. **Warn**: "Project settings.local.json SHADOWS global settings (does not merge). Session restart needed."

## Mode 3: Tidy Permissions

**When**: User says "tidy permissions" or health check found permission issues.

Launch the Permission Auditor agent, then apply its recommended fixes.

## Mode 4: Capture Learnings

**When**: End of session, "capture learnings", "save what we learned".

This runs in the **main context** (not a sub-agent) because it needs access to the conversation history.

1. Review conversation for discoveries worth preserving
2. Decide placement:
   ```
   Applies to all projects?
   ├── YES → ~/.claude/rules/<topic>.md
   └── NO  → Specific to a subdirectory?
       ├── YES → <dir>/CLAUDE.md
       └── NO  → Reference or operational?
           ├── Reference → docs/ or ARCHITECTURE.md
           └── Operational → ./CLAUDE.md (root)
   ```
3. Draft all changes as diffs in a single batch
4. Apply after single yes/no confirmation

**Keep it concise**: one line per concept.

## Mode 5: Add Preset

**When**: "add python permissions", "add docker", "add MCP servers".

1. Read the preset from [references/permission-presets.md](references/permission-presets.md)
2. Read existing `.claude/settings.local.json`
3. Merge without duplicating
4. Remind: **session restart required**

## Mode 6: Restructure Context

**When**: Root CLAUDE.md over 200 lines, "restructure memory".

1. Launch Context Auditor agent first
2. Based on findings:
   - Split oversized CLAUDE.md into `.claude/rules/<topic>.md`
   - Extract directory-specific content to sub-directory CLAUDE.md
   - Move reference material to `docs/`
   - Resolve overlaps
   - Create missing docs for project type
3. Present plan, apply after approval

### Size Targets

| File | Target | Maximum |
|------|--------|---------|
| Root CLAUDE.md | 50-150 lines | 200 |
| Sub-directory CLAUDE.md | 15-50 lines | 80 |
| Rules topic file | 20-80 lines | 120 |

## Permission Syntax Quick Reference

| Pattern | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `Bash(git *)` | Preferred — space before `*` = word boundary |
| `Bash(nvidia-smi)` | Exact match, no arguments |
| `WebFetch` | Blanket web fetch |
| `WebSearch` | Blanket web search |
| `mcp__servername__*` | All tools on one MCP server |

### What Does NOT Work

| Pattern | Why |
|---------|-----|
| `mcp__*` | Wildcard doesn't cross `__` boundary |
| `mcp__*__*` | Still doesn't work |
| `Bash(git:*)` | Deprecated colon syntax (works but prefer space) |

### Important Behaviours

- **Not hot-reloaded**: `settings.local.json` edits need session restart
- **"Don't ask again"** injects at runtime (no restart) using colon format — normal
- **Shadows, not merges**: Project settings completely replace global
- **`gh` bug**: `Bash(gh *)` sometimes misses subcommands — include explicit `Bash(gh issue *)` etc.

## Autonomy

- **Just do it**: Detect project type, launch audit agents, discover MCP servers
- **Brief confirmation**: Write/update files (single batch yes/no)
- **Ask first**: git init, GitHub repo, delete existing content, major restructures
